DigitalShredder
===============

A digital "document shredder" for testing algorithms


The "jagged line generator" project contains an implementation of the 
midpoint displacement algorithm found here...

This line is used in the shredder to create jagged lines that resemble real life shredding.

Before modifying the shred slicing it is best to test out the line function in the jagged line generator.

Change Line 43 of "jagged line generator" to change where the result of the program is saved.
